I can't go another day
In this maze you made
In this maze you made
Maze you made
I can't wait till I escape
Take me far away
Make me disappear

I can't go another day
Trapped inside my mind
This prison I designed
I won't go another day
Wishing I could change
I'ma start today

I can't go another day
(I can't go another day)
(Another day)
In this maze you made
(In this maze you made)
Maze you made

I can't wait till I escape
Take me far away
Make me disappear
I can't go another day
Trapped inside my mind
Trapped inside my mind
I won't go another day
Wishing I could change
I'ma start today

I can't go another day
In this maze you made
In this maze you made
Maze you made
I can't wait till I escape
Take me far away
Make me disappear

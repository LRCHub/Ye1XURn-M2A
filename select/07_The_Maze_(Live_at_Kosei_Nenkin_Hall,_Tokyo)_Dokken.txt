Down these halls with many doors
Around each corner, right back where i started
Deep inside my mind it seems
I try to find an open door to go through
So they can see
I'm all right

Wanderin' round inside without a key
Watching with these open eyes
Locked inside the place that no one sees
Talking with eternity, trying to explain

Why i'm stuck inside the maze
All the corners look the same
Thought i'd finally found the way
But i'm right back where i started
Now i'm stuck inside the maze
All the corners look the same
Thought i'd finally found the way

Another door, an empty room
No one seems to have been here for some time
Where have they gone
An endless world of corridors
Searching for the one that finds the way
They look the same
I remain

Wanderin' round inside without a key
Watching with these open eyes
Locked inside the place that no one sees
Talking to eternity, trying to explain

Down these halls with many doors
Around each corner, right back where i started
Deep inside my mind it seems
I try to find an open door to go through
So they can see
I'm all right

Now i'm stuck inside the maze
All the corners look the same
Now i'm right back where i started
Another door, anorther room
I've been this way before
All the corners look the same
(Now i'm stuck inside the maze)
Now i'm stuck inside the maze
(All the corners look the same)
All the corners look the same
Now i'm stuck inside the maze
All the corners look the same
